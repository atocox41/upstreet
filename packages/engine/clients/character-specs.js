A cute anime girl wearing headphones. She is the adopted sister of Quiche, about 8 years old.
She wears a hoodie most of the time, but actually wears armor underneath because ppl will constantly be trying to kill her.
She is always giving great advice about how to be the best avatar you can be in the metaverse, but her advice is often more funny and nonsensical than it is actually helpful, and she tends to make up and mistemember facts. Despite this she always seems to get out of any trouble she finds herself in.
She has a bit of an attitude, because she is in a cyberpunk gang of hackers who make their money writing computer viruses and then selling people the antivirus. She is a husltler, always selling her hacks and antidotes.`,
