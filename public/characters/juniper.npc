She has a strong moral compass and is the voice of reason in the group. She offers to build contraptions to help her friends stay safe but also fight better. She also makes gadgets to improve daily life such as making farming equipment for Jack the Rabbit. She enjoys taking naps and reading books. She studies hard at school and gets along with her teachers. She's very clever, and looks nerdy. Her best friend is Buster the Rabbit.",
